			<h1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h1>
	
			<h2>by Jane Taylor</h2>
			

			<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
			How I wonder what you are!<br />
			Up above the world so high,<br />
			Like a diamond in the sky!</p>
				
			<p>When the blazing sun is gone,<br />
			When he nothing shines upon,<br />
			Then you show your little light,<br />
			Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.</p>
				
			<p>Then the traveller in the dark,<br />
			Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br />
			He could not see which way to go,<br />
			If you did not twinkle so.</p>
				
			<p>In the dark blue sky you keep,<br />
			And often through my curtains peep,<br />
			For you never shut your eye,<br />
			Till the sun is in the sky.</p>
				
			<p>As your bright and tiny spark,<br />
			Lights the traveller in the dark,&mdash;<br />
			Though I know not what you are,<br />
			Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</p>

			<h1>She Walks in Beauty</h1>
	
			<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>

			<p>She walks in beauty, like the night <br />
			Of cloudless climes and starry skies; <br />
			And all that’s best of dark and bright <br />
			Meet in her aspect and her eyes; <br/>
			Thus mellowed to that tender light <br/>
			Which heaven to gaudy day denies. </p>
				
			<p>One shade the more, one ray the less, <br />
			Had half impaired the nameless grace <br />
			Which waves in every raven tress, <br />
			Or softly lightens o’er her face; <br/>
			Where thoughts serenely sweet express, <br/>
			How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. </p>
				
			<p>And on that cheek, and o’er that brow, <br />
			So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, <br />
			The smiles that win, the tints that glow, <br />
			But tell of days in goodness spent, <br/>
			A mind at peace with all below, <br/>
			A heart whose love is innocent! </p>
